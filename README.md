Intelligent Road Design: Exploring Autonomous Agent Approaches for Infrastructure Planning

**Abstract**: Road planning and design, as a crucial aspect of modern urban development, is becoming increasingly challenging for traditional optimization approaches. With the growing scale and complexity of real-world environments driven by urbanization and globalization, explicit modeling can become both infeasible and intractable for optimizers that rely on static objective functions and hard-coded constraints. To address this limitation, we explore the usage of a fully autonomous LLM-based agent (GPT-5), equipped with tools for construction, simulation, and reasoning to design and build road networks in a simulated world to optimize a delivery-related task. By comparing the planning capabilities of agentic AI and traditional optimizers, we demonstrate that although the agent-based approach cannot yet fully match optimizers in terms of planning objectives, it nonetheless exhibits strong potential in route planning, budget control, and interpretability, while requiring minimal manual modeling or coding.
